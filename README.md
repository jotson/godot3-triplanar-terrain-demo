This is my attempt to recreate in Godot Engine the excellent triplanar terrain shader
created by [@minionsart](https://twitter.com/minionsart/status/958716559609954304). Their tutorials are great, you should definitely follow them.

This is a [Godot Engine 3.0](https://godotengine.org) project. To open the demo:

- install Godot Engine
- extract these files into a new directory
- import the project into Godot and edit

I'm John Watson [@yafd](https://twitter.com/yafd/) and I'm making games with Godot Engine.
